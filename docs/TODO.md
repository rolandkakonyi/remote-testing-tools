# TODO: Remote Testing Tools Implementation Plan (Completed)

This document outlined the step-by-step plan to implement the remaining features for the Remote Testing Tools based on the requirements in `docs/spec.md` and the existing codebase.

**ðŸŽ‰ All implementation phases have been successfully completed!**

The Remote Testing Tools project is now feature-complete with:

- âœ… **File Attachments (v5.8)**: Full support for Base64-encoded file uploads with context integration
- âœ… **Server Foundation**: Orphaned directory cleanup and enhanced security
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests (37), integration tests (22), and E2E tests (6) with real Gemini CLI verification
- âœ… **Swift Client**: Auto-generated client with file attachment support
- âœ… **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples
- âœ… **Architecture**: Conflict-free `modules/` structure preventing Swift Package Manager collisions

**Project Status:**
- ðŸ§ª All 59 tests passing (unit + integration)
- ðŸ”— E2E tests available for manual verification with real Gemini API
- ðŸ”§ Linting clean across all workspaces  
- ðŸ“¦ Build successful for all modules
- ðŸš€ Ready for production deployment

**Recent Enhancements:**
- âœ… **End-to-End Testing**: Real Gemini CLI integration verification
- âœ… **Authentication Fix**: Proper environment variable passthrough for API keys
- âœ… **Bug Fixes**: Resolved temporary directory cleanup and argument passing issues
- âœ… **Documentation**: Comprehensive E2E testing guide and troubleshooting

The project now includes both automated testing (CI-friendly) and manual E2E verification for complete confidence in real-world functionality!
